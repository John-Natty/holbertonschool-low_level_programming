# Interactive Terminal Calculator (C)

## Project Overview

This project consists of building a **terminal-based interactive calculator** using the C programming language.

The goal is not to create a complex calculator, but to develop a **complete, structured, and disciplined C program** that:

- Compiles cleanly with strict compiler flags  
- Runs continuously in a loop  
- Uses a menu-driven interface  
- Performs correct arithmetic operations  
- Handles key edge cases (e.g., division by zero)  
- Uses `scanf` for all user input  

This project combines loops, conditionals, and functions into a single working program.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Design and structure a complete C program from requirements  
- Implement a menu-driven application using loops  
- Use conditionals to control program flow  
- Structure code into functions to avoid duplication  
- Perform arithmetic operations using basic operators (`+ - * /`)  
- Use `scanf` correctly and understand its limitations  
- Handle division by zero properly  
- Compile C code with strict flags and zero warnings
